# Advanced Blind Stick Using Adruino Nano

The people who use ordinary stick as a tool for direction, when they walk they are not able to identify that there is any obstacle in their way without the contact of the object and the stick.


So with the power of Arduino and different sensors, here we develop a tool which can serve as blind stick being more efficient and helpful than the conventional one.


This will assist the blind person during the walk and provides an alarm if any hurdle is detected within the set range.
